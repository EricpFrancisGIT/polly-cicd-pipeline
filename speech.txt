The Year 3434 of the second age. Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of the Ring of Power. 

It has come to me, The One Ring. 
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. 
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate for I will risk no hurt to the Ring. 
It is precious to me. 
Though I buy it with a great pain. 
The markings upon the band begin to fade. 
The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. 
A secret now that only fire can tell.

One Does Not Simply Walk Into Morder.  
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
There's an evil there that does not sleep.
And the Great Eye is ever watchful.
Its a barren wasteland, filled with fire, ash and dust. 
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
Not with 10,000 men could you does this.
It is Folly!
